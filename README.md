# AutoTest-GUI
Automatic Testing and Grading for beginning Python programming students and professors.
Features:
	1. Professor creates multiple "blind" data sets. (Students do not see them)
	2. Students can test their programs on blind data sets before submission for grading.
	3. Program output is evaluated on each line.  Level of matching is variable.
	4. In single test mode, grader sees program listing, output on each set, and summary report.
	5. In batch test mode, summary reports are made for all members of the class.
This is my first attempt at a GUI interface. I am learning to use tkinter and ttk.
